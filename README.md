<!-- The Project -->
## The Project

![Application Image][application-image]

This is a command-line application that will easily generate a README.md template, allowing creators to allocate more time to working on the project itself rather than on building README files. 

The project idea was driven by the huge amount of time invested in building README.md for individual projects, which after some time gets repetitive and most of us can agree time would be better allocated elsewhere. This problem makes for a quick automation via Node.js

### Technology Stack
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

<p align="right"> - <a href="#home">Return to Home</a></p>


<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
To get started you will need a couple of things - clear explanation of this below:

<p align="right"> - <a href="#home">Return to Home</a></p>

### Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as we will need it to install the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) NPM package to execute the application.

The application will run on the command-line, meaning this will be the only requirement.

<p align="right"> - <a href="#home">Return to Home</a></p>

### Installation
In order to get started, we must first install Node.js - on macOS I prefer to install it using the Homebrew package manager and on Windows using the Node.js homepage download section.

**On macOS:**
1. To install Homebrew on macOS, browse to [Homebrew's official website](https://brew.sh/) and copy the link displayed on the page on the macOS terminal. At the time of writing, this is the command: 
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew installation is complete, type the following command to install Node.js and NPM:
```shell
brew install node
```

3. Once the installation finishes, confirm that you successfully installed Node.js by checking its version:
```shell
node -v
```

**On Windows:**
1. In a web browser, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Click the Windows Installer button to download the latest default version. At the time of writing, the latest LTS version is 16.15.0.

2. Execute the installer to install Node.js

3. Once the installation finishes, confirm that you successfully installed Node.js by checking its version:
```shell
node -v
```

<!-- How to Use -->
## How to Use
First, clone this repo via HTTPS in your local computer - feel free to use any storage destination / folder of your choosing. On macOS / Windows, open the CLI (Command Line Interface) and type the following command (ensure you are located in the exact directory where you want to clone the repo):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/richardguarnieri/professional-README-generator.git
```

After the repo has sucessfully cloned, navigate to the repo using the cd (chage directory) command:
```shell
cd professional-README-generator/
``` 

Once inside the professional-README-generator directory, install the necessary node pacakges to run the application - in order to do so, pls type on the CLI the following command:
```shell
npm install
```
Above command will install the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) NPM package along all its dependencies in a newly generated folder within the professional-README-generator directory called node_modules/

Once installation finishes, we are clear to execute the application. To do so, run the index.js file typing in the CLI the following command:
```shell
node index.js
```

After execution, the program will begin a series of 17 questions.

Answers to questions 1 to 11 are required to be longer than 5 characters (except 5 and 6) and answers to questions 12 - 16 (except 15) are required to be longer than 600 characters. The questions are:

1. What is your GitHub username? (required):
1. What is your GitHub repository name? (required):
1. What is your name? (full name) (required):
1. What is your email address? (required):
1. What is your LinkedIn username?:
1. What is your Twitter username?:
1. What is your project title? (required):
1. Please write a brief (no more than 60 characters) project subtitle (required):
1. Please write the relative path of your project image/logo (e.g. ./img/logo.png) (required):
1. Please write the relative path of the application image (e.g. ./img/app-image.png) (required):
1. Please write the application URL (e.g. https://example.com/) (required):
1. Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project (required):
1. What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running (required):
1. Provide instructions and examples for use (required):
1. Please provide instructions on how other developers can contribute to the project (required):
1. Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here (required):
1. Please choose a license for your application (required):

Once you sucessfully answer all the questions, the automated **README_generated.md** file will be generated and appear in the same directory.
